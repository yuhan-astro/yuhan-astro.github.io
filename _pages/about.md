<h3>Hi there, I'm Yuhan Yang &#128075;</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DkU6jJgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Aim√© Fournier</a> and <a href="https://math.mit.edu/icg/people/laurent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Laurent Demanet</a>. My research focuses on uncertainty quantification in geophysical inverse problems, machine learning, and geo-electromagnetic methods.
</p> 

<p align = "justify"> 
I obtained my PhD in Geophysics in 2021 from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peking University</a> (PKU), China, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvImZ_oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Qinghua Huang</a>, and continued at PKU as a postdoctoral researcher , where I worked on deep learning-based processing, simulation, inversion and uncertainty quantification for geo-electromagnetic data.

From 2023 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Houston, where I collaborated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiajia Sun</a> and  <a href="https://modal.ece.uh.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiefu Chen</a> and focused on uncertainty quantification in geophysical inversion, natural hydrogen exploration, and the study of oceanic plateaus using marine magnetic data.
</p>
